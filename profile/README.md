# Aceituna CICD

The goal of this project is to create a tool for version management in CICD / Devops contexts

This will store which version of which component is deployed on which environment and give access to this data when needed

The first steps will be to create a proof of concept by implementing a small REST backend which can be contacted by CICD / Devops tools, this backend will store the data in a Database and will give access to the stored data

A simple Frontend will be implemented on this POC

After this the project will implement new features and integration tools with common CICD and Devops tools
